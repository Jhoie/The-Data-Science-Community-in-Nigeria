# The-Data-Science-Community-in-Nigeria
This repo uses a kaggle dataset to describe the data science community in Nigeria

# Introduction
Kaggle is the world's largest Data Science Community and from 10/07/2020 to 10/30/2020 they conducted a survey to have a  comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. 

I would be carring out an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Data Science response from Nigeria because it had more respondents than any other African country and it's also my motherland so i'll like to get more information about her.

You can download the dataset from the link below and try something similar for your country.
